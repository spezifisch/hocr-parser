In facsimilea photocell is caused
to perform a raster scan over the
subject copy. The variations of print
density on the document cause the
photocell to generate an analogous
electrical video signal. This signal is
used to modulate a carrier, which is
transmitted to a remote destination
over a radio or cable
communications link.

At the remote terminal.
demodulation reconstructs the video
signal, which is used to modulate the
density ofprint produced by a
printing device. This device is
scanning in a raster scan
synchronised with that at the
transmitting terminal. As a result, a
facsimile copy of the subject
document is produced.
